\opt{CXFLOWJARSHA256}{<sha256 text>}{CXFLOW\_JAR\_SHA256}

\noindent\\Set this value with a SHA-256 hash that is expected to match the \cxflow jar.  
If replacing the \cxflow jar using \texttt{CXFLOW\_ALT\_JAR\_URL},
validating the correct hash value before execution is highly encouraged.  
If the SHA-256 of the \cxflow jar to be executed does not match
the provided SHA-256, the jar will not be executed.

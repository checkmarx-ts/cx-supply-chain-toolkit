\section*{Preface}

Many supply chain scan integrations are performed similar to the integration
described in Section \ref{sssec:happy_path}
\hyperref[sssec:happy_path]{\textit{Execution Environment Happy Path}}. It
is then often discovered that only a small number of projects can produce
an accurate dependency tree due to the issues described in Section
\ref{sssec:generic_environment}
\hyperref[sssec:generic_environment]{\textit{Generic Execution Environment}} or
Section \ref{sssec:remote_environment}
\hyperref[sssec:remote_environment]{\textit{Remote Execution Environment}}.

\noindent\\This part of the manual will provide some options for integrating
supply chain scans into workflows executed by tools running
in a customized build environment on the local corporate network.
